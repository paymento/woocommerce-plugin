== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the **Paymento API** to process cryptocurrency payments. Paymento is a non-custodial payment gateway that enables WooCommerce stores to accept payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.

### ðŸ“Œ **Data Sent to Paymento API**
The plugin interacts with the Paymento API for the following purposes:

- **Payment Verification**  
  - The plugin sends payment transaction details to `https://api.paymento.io/v1/payment/verify` to confirm if a payment was successfully made.  
  - This request is triggered when an order is placed or needs verification.  

- **Fetching Merchant Information**  
  - Calls `https://api.paymento.io/v1/ping/merchant/` to retrieve the storeâ€™s registered name and confirm API connectivity.  
  - This request is made when setting up the payment gateway in WooCommerce.  

- **Setting Callback URLs**  
  - The plugin sends data to `https://api.paymento.io/v1/payment/settings/` to configure callback URLs for payment notifications.  
  - This happens when the payment gateway is set up for the first time.  

- **Submitting Payment Requests**  
  - When a customer selects crypto payment, the plugin sends a request to `https://api.paymento.io/v1/payment/request` with order details.  
  - This allows Paymento to generate a payment invoice for the user.  

- **API Health Check**  
  - A request to `https://api.paymento.io/v1/ping/` ensures the API is operational before processing payments.  


### ðŸ”— **Third-Party Policies**
By using this plugin, your WooCommerce store communicates with **Paymento API**. You can review Paymentoâ€™s terms and policies here:  

- **Terms of Service**: [https://paymento.io/terms](https://paymento.io/terms)  
- **Privacy Policy**: [https://paymento.io/privacy](https://paymento.io/privacy)  

This ensures users are **fully aware** of the data being sent and why. ðŸš€  

== Troubleshooting ==

If you encounter any issues:

1. Enable Debug Log in the plugin settings.
2. Check the WooCommerce status report (WooCommerce > Status > Logs) for detailed error messages.
3. Ensure your API Key and Secret Key are correct.
